# Welcome to Data Visualization for Food Scientists

Throughout this Jupyter book we will be focusing on creating data visualizations using Python. There are many different 
ways to create plots in Python - we won't be discussing all of them here. Instead, we will see how to 
create most of the basic plots using the very popular seaborn library. Following this overview, we 
will look at how one can use matplotlib (which seaborn also uses in the background) to modify and 
customize new plots or the ones created with seaborn.
