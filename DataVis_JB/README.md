### Recreating the book

In order to be able to reproduce the Jupyter Book's contents with the materials of the 
repository, please follow the steps to download and install the Jupyter Book first.
You can find the detailed steps regarding the Windows OS in the `main` branch of the repository.

Then in the folder that encapsulates the files and folders of the book you can run 
`jupyer-book create DataVis_JB` and it will create a `_build` folder. Inside this folder you can 
localize the `index.html` file that will start everything.
